# Druid Ranger Security extension

Druid Ranger Security with patched security vulnerabilities.

This repository contains an extension that removes the log4j dependency from the extension. It is done by updating Ranger libraries to the newest available version.

The functioning of this library does not change and you can find the configuration reference on [the Druid website](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/development/extensions-core/druid-ranger-security.html).

You can download the `.tar.gz` from our [Release page](https://github.com/deep-bi/druid-ranger-security/releases).
